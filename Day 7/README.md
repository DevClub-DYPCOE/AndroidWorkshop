# What's New?

We developed Calculator app which adds, subtracts, multiplies and divides two numbers.

## New Concepts:
- Parsing Number from String input :
In Java, to get number from string, we have to use wrapper classes to convert it as follows.
```java
int x = Integer.parseInt(string_var);
```
